My choice for the tech event is The UX Lab NYC's Media Lab Summit happening on Friday, September 25th at the NYU Skirball Center. 

My schema has three models, user, post, and comment. 
User has many_comments and has_many posts, and has the attributes first_name, last_name, username, and email. 
Post has many_comments, and belongs_to user, and has the attributes title, text, and score. 
Comment belongs_to user and belongs_to post, and has the attributes username, text, and score.
